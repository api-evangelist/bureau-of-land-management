      The Mineral & Land Records System (MLRS) is an online platform delivering
      state-of-the-art mineral and land records transactions, tracking, mapping,
      and more for BLM customers and staff. MLRS has replaced and integrated
      many legacy BLM systems (e.g., LR2000, Alaskas ACRES/ALIS, LRAM, CSRC) to
      more efficiently manage resources and cases across a range of BLM actions
      and business processes.
